  text:
  - Being alone on the battlefield to defend objective would be harder if you stay
    too long
  - To help yourself with that, you can use emplacement weapon to defend objective
    with you
  - There are 3 types of emplacement weapons
  - Red, Yellow and Green
  - Red, Yellow, you will need to place them on their own marked position or else
    you won't be able to activate them
  - For green you can activate them any where on the map
  - Once you place the emplacment weapon platform on ground, you can activate them
    by pressing button on it
  - Once you press it, emplacement weapon will fall down from sky to the postiion
  - 'FOR RED EMPLACEMENT WEAPON: you will need to fill up gas if the weapon fuel
    runs out or else it will shutdown itself '
  - 'If the emplacement weapon are too weak for you, you can upgrade them to be more
    deadly by using the upgrade gun '
