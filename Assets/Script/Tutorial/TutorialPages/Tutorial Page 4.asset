  - The longer you stay on the battlefield, the more amount of zombie you will get,
    to help you with that problem, the military  have invented emplacement weapon
    system which can help you reduce some amount of zombie on the battlefield
  - 'There are two types of emplacement weapons, which are: red and green'
  - 'FOR RED EMPLACEMENT WEAPONS: you will need to give more battery for the weapon
    to prevent it from shutting down, if the weapon fuel runs out, it will shutdown
    itself, you can check the red emplacement weapon fuel on the tablet that been
    attached on itself '
  - 'FOR GREEN EMPLACEMENT WEAPONS: you can place anywhere on the level and you won''t
    need to fill up it fuel'
